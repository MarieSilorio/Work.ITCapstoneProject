Research and Development Process
The team first identified the common problems that are prevalent in Iligan City today. After the problem to be tackled was finalized and approved, the team conducted a meeting to discuss the next steps to take for the project. Essential components for the website that's found in the SRS were completed first. Afterwards, Mr. Ramber came up with the wireframe to create a visualization and guide to follow for the web development process. Creation and refinement of the wireframe were carried over to the development of the website and the team was able to finish some pages before the final presentation of the project.
